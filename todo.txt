1. Take clumped SNPs, plus those that get thrown away in log file because not in 1000 genomes, plus established SNP
   * Then generate a plink subset in MVP, that will include all LD stats for all SNPs (and we don't miss anything)
   * Because now is only G1K

2. Combined set: When multiple identical entries from different ethnicities (then collapse into 1, take smallest p-value) 
   * add columns for each (TRANS-P, EUR-P, AFR-P, SAS-P, AMR-P)

3. Flags: 
   * green (novel lead: smallest p-value in a block, not in 500kb region of established variant, not in LD with established variant)
   * yellow (novel secondary: physically close to novel variant, not in LD)   
   * orange (tertiary signal: physically close to established variant, not in LD, might be independent)
   * red (known variant: in LD with established SNP and/or 500kb region)
   
4. Extra:
   * locuszoom plot
   * R-coloc analysis with eQTL data (Casey Brown)
   * GCTA-COJO analysis (conditional & joint analysis of GWAS summary statistics without individual-level genotype data)
   * coding variants (MAC > 30 : MAF < 0.025)
   * X chromosome
